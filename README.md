# Overview 
This repository contains the reproduction and expansion of the study "Sexism and the Far-Right Vote: The Individual Dynamics of Gender Backlash" by Eva Anduiza and Guillem Rico (2024). The original study examines the role of sexist beliefs in predicting support for the far-right party Vox in Spain. The expansion compares KNN and random forest models in their ability to predict Spanish voters' political affiliation based on their beliefs on social issues such as sexism and nativism. 

This project is divided into two key components:

- Reproduction of Original Results

- Expansion with Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Each section aims to deepen understanding of supervised learning workflows and evaluate model performance using different approaches.
